        Our team plays Plants vs Brainrots daily, and we wanted a central hub that keeps track of every plant, brainrot, and mutation. The goal is to
        combine verified stats with calculators that remove guesswork. This MVP is the foundationâ€”we will keep expanding coverage as the community
        shares feedback.
